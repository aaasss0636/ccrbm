The files in this folder can be used to extract patches from the DICOM
files in the ILD dataset. For the dataset, see the description in

  Building a reference multimedia database for interstitial lung diseases
  by Adrien Depeursinge et al.
  in Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (April 2012)
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2011.07.003

The dataset is available on request, see

Once you have downloaded the data, the MATLAB scripts in this folder can
be used to extract labelled patches from the DICOM files.

  * extract_all.m loops over all subjects
  * extract_one.m loads one subject and saves a .mat file with patches
  * extract_ild_patch.m does the actual work of extracting the patches

The scripts extract 2D patches of 32x32 voxels. A patch is included if
at least 75 percent of the voxels in that patch belong to the same tissue
class. This approach is roughly similar to that used in

  Multiscale lung texture signature learning using the Riesz transform
  by Adrien Depeursinge et al.
  in MICCAI (2012)

and other papers that use the same dataset. Unfortunately, the number of
patches extracted differ slightly between papers, which suggests that the
rules can be implemented in different ways.

The implementation provided here was used for the experiments in
